# Smart Lighting System
A smart lighting system using Tinker CAD. Sliding the point on bar towards Day or Night on the LDR, it detects the brightness intensity. The Raw values can be seen on Serial Monitor. Any value below 500 means it is dark outside and any value above 500 means it is bright. Based on this value, the bulb should switch ON at night and switch OFF during day.
